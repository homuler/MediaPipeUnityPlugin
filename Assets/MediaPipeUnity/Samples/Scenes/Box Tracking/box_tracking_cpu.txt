# CHANGES:
#   - ImageTransformationCalculator rotates the input and flips the output
#   - Remove RendererSubgraphCpu

# MediaPipe graph that performs object detection and tracking with TensorFlow
# Lite on CPU.
# Used in the examples in
# mediapipie/examples/desktop/object_tracking/

# Images on CPU coming into and out of the graph.
