# CHANGES:
#   - `input_video` is ImageFrame (ImageFrameToGpuBufferCalculator converts it into GpuBuffer)
#   - Add ImageTransformationCalculator and rotate the input
#   - Remove FaceRendererGpu

# MediaPipe graph that performs face mesh with TensorFlow Lite on GPU.

# Input image. (ImageFrame)

# Max number of faces to detect/process. (int)
input_side_packet: "num_faces"

# Collection of detected/processed faces, each represented as a list of
# landmarks. (std::vector<NormalizedLandmarkList>)

# Throttles the images flowing downstream for flow control. It passes through
# the very first incoming image unaltered, and waits for downstream nodes
# (calculators and subgraphs) in the graph to finish their tasks before it
# passes through another image. All images that come in while waiting are
# dropped, limiting the number of in-flight images in most part of the graph to
# 1. This prevents the downstream nodes from queuing up incoming images and data
# excessively, which leads to increased latency and memory usage, unwanted in
# real-time mobile applications. It also eliminates unnecessarily computation,
# e.g., the output produced by a node may get dropped downstream if the
# subsequent nodes are still busy processing previous inputs.
