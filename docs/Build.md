This repository does not include the libraries (e.g. \*.so, \*.dll) and models (e.g. \*.tflite) required to run MediaPipeUnityPlugin.\
You can download pre-built packages that include these files from [the release page](https://github.com/homuler/MediaPipeUnityPlugin/releases).

However, you'll need to build the libraries yourself in the following cases:

- You want to reduce the library size by removing unnecessary code.
- You want to use calculators that are not included in the release package.
- You want to try out the latest features that are not yet included in the release package.
- You want to use a different version of MediaPipe, especially [a customized version](#how-to-use-a-customized-version-of-mediapipe).

This documentation describes how to build the package yourself.

# (Recommended) Using GitHub Actions

This repository includes a GitHub Actions Workflow for building libraries, so it's the easiest way to build the package.\
Fork this repository and run [the build-package workflow](https://github.com/homuler/MediaPipeUnityPlugin/actions/workflows/build-package.yml) in your forked repository.

![The build-package workflow page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97760494-5c53-49e1-8fa7-34fdd3a05239)

For information on what values to specify when running the build workflow, please refer to the [Build Command](#build-command) section.

# Building Locally

While [using GitHub Actions](#recommended-using-github-actions) is recommended for building for all platforms, you can also build in your local environment, for example when doing trial & error on your PC.

> :bell: If you encounter build issues, please refer to the GitHub Actions workflow definition.
> If the error cannot be reproduced in the GitHub Actions workflow, we generally cannot provide support.

## Supported Platforms

## Building on Linux

> :warning: When building a library (`libmediapipe_c.so`) for Linux, if the GLibc version on the target machine is older than the GLibc version on the machine where the library was built, the library will not work.

### (Recommended) Building with Docker

> :warning: When building a library (`libmediapipe_c.so`) for Linux, it cannot be used if the GLibc version on the target machine < 2.31.

1. Install Docker

   Ensure that you can run the `docker` command without `sudo`.

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```sh
   docker build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) -t mediapipe_unity:latest . -f docker/linux/x86_64/Dockerfile
   ```

1. Start the Docker container:

   ```sh
   # Mount the `Packages` directory to the container and start it.
   docker run \
       --mount type=bind,src=$PWD/Packages,dst=/home/mediapipe/Packages \
       --mount type=bind,src=$PWD/Assets,dst=/home/mediapipe/Assets \
       -it mediapipe_unity:latest
   ```

1. Run [the build script](#build-script) on the container:

   ```sh
   # Example of building for Desktop (GPU) and Android
   python build.py build --desktop gpu --opencv cmake --android arm64 -v
   ```

Once the command completes successfully, the necessary files will be installed on the host machine.

## Building for Android

When building for Android (Linux/macOS), follow these additional steps:

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)

1. Launch Android Studio, open **SDK Manager > SDK Tools**, and install Android SDK Build Tools and Android NDK

   > :bell: Please note the following two points:
   >
   > - While Bazel automatically uses the latest installed Build Tools, versions 31.0.0 and above do not work properly, so you need to uncheck versions 31.0.0 and above.
   > - Since NDK versions r22 and above are not supported, please use NDK version 21.4.7075529 or lower.
   >
   > ![Android Studio (SDK Tools)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4690128/144735652-21339ab0-5a45-4277-b7ee-39d106b5e1e6.png)

1. Set environment variables

   ```sh
   # Set ANDROID_HOME
   # Set the path to the directory containing `platforms` and `platform-tools`
   export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/SDK

   # Set ANDROID_NDK_HOME
   # This is typically something like `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/21.4.7075529`
   export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/NDK
   ```

1. When running the build command, you may want to specify the `--android_ndk_api_level` option.

   ```sh
   python build.py build --android arm64 --android_ndk_api_level 21 -vv
   ```

# Build Script

`build.py` supports the following commands.

|   Command   |                        Description                        |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: |
|   `build`   | Build and install required files (libraries, model files) |
|   `clean`   |       Clean cache directories (`build`, `bazel-*`)        |
| `uninstall` |                  Remove installed files                   |

## Build Command

Run `python build.py build --help` for more details.

```sh
# Build for Desktop with GPU enabled.
python build.py build --desktop gpu --opencv cmake -vv

# Build for Desktop with GPU disabled.
python build.py build --desktop cpu --opencv cmake -vv

# Build a Universal macOS Library (macOS only).
python build.py build --desktop cpu --opencv cmake --macos_universal -vv

# Build for Desktop, Android, and iOS
python build.py build --desktop cpu --android arm64 --ios arm64 --opencv cmake -vv

# Specify Android NDK level
python build.py build --android arm64 --android_ndk_api_level 21 -vv

# Specify required solutions
python build.py build --desktop gpu --opencv cmake --solutions face_mesh hands pose -vv
```

You can also specify the compilation mode and linker options.

```sh
# Build with debug symbols.
python build.py build -c dbg --android arm64 -vv

# Omit all symbol information.
# This can significantly reduce the library size.
python build.py build --android arm64 --linkopt=-s -vv
```

# Known Issues

1. (iOS) In some situations, the iOS Framework won't be updated.

   Due to [an issue with bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12389), we cannot determine the output path beforehand.\
   If you have built this plugin across versions, you may encounter this problem.\
   In that case, run `python build.py clean` and try your build command again.

# Troubleshooting

## DllNotFoundException

This error can occur for a variety of reasons, so it is necessary to isolate the cause.

1.  Native libraries are not built yet

If native libraries (`libmediapipe_c.{so,dylib,dll} / mediapipe_android.aar / MediaPipeUnity.Framework`) don't exist under `Packages/com.github.homuler.mediapipe/Runtime/Plugins`, run the [build command](#build-command) first, and make sure that the command finishes successfully.

1.  Native libraries are incompatible with your device

   -  Libraries built on Linux machines (`libmediapipe_c.so`) won't work on your Windows machine.
   -  If it occurs on your Android device, maybe

      - the architecture is wrong (`--android armv7`) or
      - the API Level is not compatible (specify the `--android_ndk_api_level` option when running the [build command](#build-command)) or
      - `libc++_shared.so` is not bundled with your apk(cf. [README](../README.md#for-android))

1.  Dependent libraries are not linked

This error occurs when some symbols in the libraries are undefined and cannot be resolved at runtime, which is very typical when OpenCV is not configured properly.\
 If the cause lies in OpenCV, you can also build and link OpenCV statically with the `--opencv cmake` option instead.

**Tips**\
 In this case, when you check [Load on startup](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PluginInspector.html) and click the `Apply` button, error logs like the following will be output.

```txt
Plugins: Couldn't open Packages/com.github.homuler.mediapipe/Runtime/Plugins/libmediapipe_c.so, error:  Packages/com.github.homuler.mediapipe/Runtime/Plugins/libmediapipe_c.so: undefined symbol: _ZN2cv8fastFreeEPv
```

1.  Dependent libraries do not exist or are not loaded

    When you build an app and copy it to another machine, you need to bundle dependent libraries with it.

    For example, if you linked OpenCV dynamically, OpenCV must be installed on the target machine too.\
    If you are unsure of the cause, try checking the dependent libraries using a command such as `ldd`.

1.  When you cannot identify the cause...

    If the error occurs on UnityEditor, try loading `{lib}mediapipe_c.{so,dylib,dll}` on startup.

    ![load-on-startup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4690128/135591282-8a2011b1-9ae8-4a6a-a5fb-cc3a21f1125f.png)

    `DllNotFoundException` should be thrown right after that, and if you're lucky, the error message will be more verbose now.

    Otherwise, try loading the library (on your target device) by yourself using tools or code like below.
